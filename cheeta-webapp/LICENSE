# Cheeta Ethical License v1.0 (CEL-1.0)

## Preamble

The Cheeta Ethical License (CEL) is designed to promote sustainable open source development by balancing developer freedom with corporate responsibility. This license recognizes that individuals and small organizations should have unrestricted access to software, while large organizations that derive significant value from the software should contribute back to the ecosystem that supports them.

The goal is simple: keep open source free and accessible for those building their careers and businesses, while ensuring that well-resourced organizations fairly compensate the maintainers whose work they depend upon.

## 1. Grant of Rights

### 1.1 Individual Developer Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Maintainer hereby grants to each Individual Developer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

a) Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and/or sublicense copies of the Software;

c) Create derivative works of the Software;
d) Use the Software without attribution requirements (though attribution is appreciated);
e) Use the Software without any obligation to contribute back to the project.

**Clarification:** An individual freelancer, consultant, or contractor working for a Large Organization is still considered an Individual Developer for their own personal use of the Software. However, the Large Organization employing or contracting with that individual must separately comply with Section 3 if they use the Software.

### 1.2 Small Organization Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Maintainer hereby grants to each Small Organization all rights granted to Individual Developers under Section 1.1, with the following additional terms:

a) Small Organizations may use the Software for any Commercial Use;
b) Small Organizations must provide attribution to the Maintainer in product documentation, "About" pages, or similar visible locations where third-party software credits are typically displayed;
c) Attribution must include: (i) the name of the Software, (ii) the name of the Maintainer, and (iii) a link to the official Software repository or website;
d) Small Organizations are encouraged, but not required, to contribute back to the Software.

### 1.3 Transition Provisions

If a Small Organization grows and becomes a Large Organization:

a) The organization has a **90-day grace period** from the date it first meets the Large Organization criteria to select and implement a Compliance Option under Section 3;
b) Any deployments of the Software made while the organization qualified as a Small Organization may continue under Small Organization terms for up to **12 months** after becoming a Large Organization;
c) New deployments or significant updates to the Software after becoming a Large Organization must immediately comply with Section 3;
d) The organization must notify the Maintainer within 30 days of becoming a Large Organization.

---

## 2. Large Organization Obligations

### 2.1 Compliance Requirement

Large Organizations may NOT use the Software unless they have selected and are actively maintaining compliance with one of the Compliance Options specified in Section 3.

### 2.2 Prohibition on Use Without Compliance

Any use of the Software by a Large Organization that has not selected a Compliance Option, or that is not in good standing with its selected Compliance Option, is unauthorized and constitutes copyright infringement.

### 2.3 Reporting Requirement

Large Organizations must report their selected Compliance Option to the Maintainer within 30 days of first using the Software. Reporting may be done through:
a) The official Software repository (via issue, pull request, or designated form);
b) Direct communication with the Maintainer;
c) Any reporting mechanism specified by the Maintainer.

---

## 3. Compliance Options for Large Organizations

Large Organizations must select and maintain compliance with ONE of the following options:

### Option A: Code Contribution

The Large Organization agrees to contribute meaningful code improvements, bug fixes, or features back to the Software project.

**Minimum Contribution Requirements (choose one):**

1. **Time-Based Contribution:**
   - Dedicate a minimum of 1% of the total developer time spent using or working with the Software to contributing improvements back to the project;
   - Measured on a quarterly basis;
   - Contributions must be substantial (not trivial formatting changes);
   - Must be submitted via pull requests to the official repository.

2. **Issue-Based Contribution:**
   - Fix and submit pull requests for at least 2 bugs or issues per quarter that your organization encounters while using the Software;
   - Bugs must be meaningful (not documentation typos);
   - Pull requests must be accepted by Maintainer to count.

3. **Feature Contribution:**
   - Contribute at least one significant feature or enhancement per year that benefits the broader community;
   - Feature scope must be agreed upon with Maintainer in advance;
   - Must include tests and documentation.

**Good Faith Standard:**
Contributions must be made in good faith to genuinely improve the Software for all users, not merely to satisfy the minimum requirements. The Maintainer reserves the right to reject contributions that are not useful or that create maintenance burden.

### Option B: Financial Support

The Large Organization agrees to provide fair financial compensation to the Maintainer(s) for the value derived from the Software.

**Minimum Payment Requirements:**

The Large Organization must pay the GREATER of:

1. **$500 USD per month** (or local currency equivalent), OR
2. **0.1% (one-tenth of one percent) of gross annual revenue** derived from products or services that incorporate, utilize, or depend upon the Software.

**Payment Terms:**
- Payments must be made monthly or quarterly (at organization's discretion);
- Payments must be made through a method specified by the Maintainer (e.g., GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, bank transfer, or other payment processor);
- Payment receipts or transaction records must be retained for audit purposes;
- If revenue-based payment applies, annual revenue reports must be provided to Maintainer.

**Revenue Calculation:**
- For organizations where the Software is embedded in a product: revenue from that product only;
- For organizations using Software as infrastructure: calculate based on proportional use across revenue-generating services;
- Revenue is calculated on a calendar or fiscal year basis (organization's choice, but must be consistent).

### Option C: Commercial License

The Large Organization may negotiate a separate commercial license agreement directly with the Maintainer.

**Terms:**
- Contact Maintainer to discuss custom terms;
- Commercial license may include support, warranties, indemnification, or other provisions not available under this License;
- Pricing and terms are negotiated on a case-by-case basis;
- Once executed, the commercial license supersedes this License for that organization.

### Option D: Open Source Reciprocity

The Large Organization may choose to open source the portions of their software that directly use or integrate with the Software.

**Requirements:**

1. **Scope of Open Sourcing:**
   - Any module, component, or service that directly imports, links to, or integrates with the Software must be released as open source;
   - "Directly" means within the same process, service boundary, or tightly coupled interface;
   - Network APIs, microservices communicating over HTTP/gRPC, or similar loose coupling does NOT require open sourcing;

2. **License Requirements:**
   - Open sourced components must use a license compatible with CEL-1.0;
   - Acceptable licenses include: CEL-1.0, MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, GPL v3, LGPL v3, AGPL v3;
   - Must be published on a publicly accessible repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab);

3. **Documentation:**
   - Must document how the open sourced component uses the Software;
   - Must maintain the open source release for as long as the organization continues using the Software;

4. **Good Faith:**
   - The open sourced portion must represent meaningful software, not a trivial wrapper;
   - Must include reasonable documentation and ability for others to build and use it.

### 3.1 Changing Compliance Options

Large Organizations may change their selected Compliance Option with 30 days' written notice to the Maintainer, provided they:
a) Have been in compliance with their current option for at least 6 months;
b) Continue to meet all obligations under the previous option during the transition period;
c) Begin immediately complying with the new option upon the transition date.
