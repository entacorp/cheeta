# Cheeta Platform

The AI-powered, social DevOps platform built by developers, for developers. Self-hosted or cloud, with features that actually make your life better.

## Vision

To provide a single, unified, AI-first development platform for modern teams—reducing tool sprawl and integrating every aspect of the DevOps lifecycle into one streamlined, beautiful interface that developers actually want to use.

**"I built this on Cheeta."** — That's what we're building for.

## Why Cheeta?

### The Problem
- GitHub feels corporate and bloated
- You need 10+ tools just to ship code (GitHub + CircleCI + Jira + Slack + Sentry + ...)
- GitHub Copilot is good, but AI should be everywhere, not just in your editor
- Open source maintainers burn out because companies take without giving back
- No built-in community features for self-hosted platforms
- Job hunting is disconnected from your actual work

### The Cheeta Solution
✅ **AI-Native Everything** - Not bolted on. Built in from day one.
✅ **One Platform** - Git, CI/CD, Issues, PRs, AI, Community, Jobs—all unified
✅ **Developer-First Social** - GitHub-style social features with privacy control
✅ **Fair Licensing** - Introducing the Cheeta Ethical License (CEL)
✅ **Self-Hosted or Cloud** - Your choice, your data, your control
✅ **Actually Sustainable** - Built-in sponsorships for open source projects
✅ **No Enshittification** - Built for pride, not for exit

### We Won't:
- ❌ Sell your data
- ❌ Show you ads
- ❌ Enshittify the product for quarterly earnings

## FAQ

### Is Cheeta open source?
The platform itself is proprietary, but we're building it transparently. Your code and data remain yours, and we support open source through:
- Free tier for OSS projects
- Cheeta Ethical License
- Built-in sponsorships

### Can I migrate from GitHub/GitLab?
Yes! We have migration tools for:
- Repositories (including history)
- Issues and PRs
- Users and teams
- CI/CD pipelines

### Does AI require sending my code to third parties?
For cloud users, yes (OpenAI/Anthropic with encryption).
For self-hosted users, you can:
- Use local LLMs (no external calls)
- Bring your own API keys
- Use our hosted AI (data encrypted)

Your code never trains external models without explicit consent.

### What about vendor lock-in?
We fight lock-in:
- Git is Git (standard protocol)
- Export all your data anytime
- API for everything
- No proprietary formats
- Self-hosted option available

### How is this different from GitHub/GitLab?
- **AI-first design** (not bolted on)
- **Built-in community** (DevFeed)
- **Integrated job board**
- **Fair licensing** (Cheeta Ethical License)
- **One unified platform** (not acquisitions duct-taped together)
- **Sustainable business model** (support open source)
- **Developer happiness first** (not corporate quarterly goals)

### Who's behind Cheeta?
Built by developers frustrated with the current state of DevOps tools. We're funded by revenue, not VC money, so we can focus on making developers happy instead of hitting growth metrics.

## The Mission

**Make developer tools that developers actually love.**

We're tired of:
- Tool sprawl and context switching
- Enshittified products chasing quarterly earnings
- Open source maintainers burning out
- AI being an afterthought
- Corporate platforms that don't care about developers

We're building Cheeta as the platform we wish existed:
- **All-in-one** but not bloated
- **AI-powered** but not gimmicky
- **Community-driven** but with privacy
- **Sustainable** for maintainers and users
- **Beautiful** because we care

**"I built this on Cheeta."**

That's our North Star. When developers say that with pride, we've succeeded.

**Built with pride by developers, for developers.**
